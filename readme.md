# Challenge 1:

## Technologies

### General comments

1. I want to minimize usage of API keys so that the service can be uploaded and reused
2. I want to focus mostly on backend, so i will be using a basic frontend

### Frontend

    Vite with react-ts
    React is an easy to use frontend library.
    Vite takes care of creating a local server, watching file changes, and building the frontend project.

### Backend

    NestJS framework with typescript
    NestJS framework provides the skeleton for a maintainable architecture. Forcing controllers, modules, and providing dependency injection systems. NestJS also contains a lot of out of the box systems making it easy to implement complex features.

### Database

    MongoDB
    MongoDB is easy to deploy and use with NestJS.
